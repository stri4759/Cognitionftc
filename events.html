        <h3>Social Media Campaign</h3>
        <p> The Pr0Teens run social media accounts on various platforms including Instagram and
            Twitter!
            We post on these accounts regularly, aiming to increase knowledge and interaction based
            on robotics and technology through informative posts.
            Our other posts include polls, trivia, and Q&As to keep it more engaging for our
            audience! If you're interested in learning more about robotics and keeping up with our
            events, visit our social media accounts in the Contact page!

        <h3>Pr0teens Explore!</h3>
        <p> Since the start of the Freight Frenzy season, we've launched a new outreach campaign
            called: Pr0teens Explore!
            The series features various workshops teaching programming, mechanics and design.
            Our first workshop was held on November 25th, featuring Jason and HB teaching some 3D
            design basics!
            We've also launched a <b>3D design competition</b> where students create their own
            designs.
        </p>
        <p> We've also launched a second workshop on coding called <b>Pr0Teens Explore: Coding
            Challenge.</b>
            This workshop was held on February 3 by, Iris Mo and Helen Yin. It was
            focused on Java for those who are beginners and have little to no experience in
            coding.
            The workshop will help students to tackle challenges after learning about basic
            programming structures and how to write simple programs.

        <h3>Summer Camp Outreach</h3>
        <p>
            Over the summer, the Pr0Teens partnered worked as a part of the FTC summer institute,
            at <b>Saint Ann Catholic Academy</b>, which provided programming and STEM opportunities
            for over 40 underserved students. This year, we plan on creating and expanding our own
            camp and are currently in contact with schools to set it up.
        </p>
        <h3>Online Scrimmage</h3>
        <p>
            On August 17, 2022, We had a friendly virtual competition with two high-performing teams
            from China.
        </p>
        <h3>Pr0Teens LEGO Robotics Summer Camp</h3>
        <p>
            This week-long summer camp, students learned essential skills to prepare them for
            the FLL (First Lego League). As a team, we prepared a high-quality curriculum that
            introduces the tools, assembly instructions, and programming aspects of building a
            successful FLL robot. This was a completely free program for anybody who wanted to
            attend. <a

            Our team competed at an off-season Freight Frenzy competition at the CNE.
            This was the first time our team competed in an in-person competition! With our new
            and improved robot, we ranked first individually and our alliance placed second in
            the finals !
