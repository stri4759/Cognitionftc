        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Our team was founded at the beginning of 2021 as a new version of the legendary team Thunderbots. Most of us were just entering high school or even younger. At this time, our only experience was with FLL and block-based programming. 
            Therefore, we faced a learning curve when it came to learning with Java. However, we were initially taught Java by a veteran of the software programming industry who was instrumental in helping us take off.

        <br><br>


<p> After we learned the ropes, we were able to begin programming. We faced many errors that we did not know how to solve, but with the help of some helpful people on Google, we were able to find solutions to our problems. In this, we learned one of the first main lessons of programming: It is not wrong to ask for help when needed. In experiencing these errors we learned the value of each and every file in the SDK in making the overall product work. Fast forward a couple of months, and we still cannot claim that we are master programmers. However, we are now somewhat literate in Java code and looking forward to the future. </p>
